Key insights:
- Indonesia's production accounts for about 30% of ASEAN's total rice production 📊
- Vietnam has significantly increased production in recent years 📈
- Thailand maintains stable production despite climate challenges ☔

Despite high production, Indonesia still imports rice due to:
1. High domestic demand from its large population 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

- Malaysia imports despite having higher GDP per capita 💰
- Even large producers like Vietnam (2,773 thousand tons) and Indonesia (1,930 thousand tons) still import rice 🏭

Reasons for imports:
- Population growth outpacing production 📈
- Climate change impacts on local production ☔

- Myanmar (8,426 thousand tons) and Cambodia (3,213 thousand tons) are emerging exporters 🚀

- 1,912 kcal (Singapore)

Key findings:
